# http5110
Repo to store files from HTTP5110 - Bernard Monette

Monday 2:25 pm - 5:05 pm

In this class I learned some key concepts of web development, we created a simple web page, installed docker and used commands to create, delete, move folders and finally we uploaded our resume to GitHub Pages

- **Docker:** https://www.docker.com

### CLI

	```
    {
        [monette@apollo ~]$ cd
        [monette@apollo ~]$ mkdir playground
        [monette@apollo ~]$ cd playground
        [monette@apollo playground]$ mkdir dir1 dir2

    }
    ```
